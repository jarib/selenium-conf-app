  	<h2>About the conference</h2>
    <p>The Selenium Conference brings together Selenium developers and enthusiasts from around the world to share ideas, socialize, and work together on advancing the present and future success of the project.</p>
	<p>The conference begins Monday with all-day workshops, followed by two days of talks. We’ll have a main track and a second informal track for other presentations. There will be pair-coding sessions throughout the day, as well as opportunities to get Selenium advice and tutorials from experts. We’re having a kickoff party Monday night and a speaker dinner Tuesday night.</p>
